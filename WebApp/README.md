## Description

This repository contains the main front-end and back-end repository as well as the docker-compose.yaml.

As of today, the public docker-compose version does not allow the use of profile, a core feature for the development of the project.

Until further news, the github profile feature will be put on hold.

## History

The goal of this project is to improve my skills and knowledge as a fullstack developper.

This will allow me to discover and master framework required for any future work experiences.
